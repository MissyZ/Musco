      Houston Astros Set to Install Musco’s LED Lighting System New Lighting System to Reduce Operating Costs by $1 Million Over the Next Decade</div>
                HOUSTON, TX and Oskaloosa, Iowa--When Major League Baseball’s Houston Astros take the field on April 11 against the Kansas City Royals at Minute Maid Park, it will be under Musco’s cutting-edge SportsCluster Green™ LED system.  As part of a significant renovation to Minute Maid Park, the new lighting system will provide unprecedented levels of energy efficiency and enhance the spectator experience at the ballpark. 

            <p>The new system replaces the original metal halide lighting equipment that was installed when the 40,000-seat stadium opened in 2000.  The prior lighting consumed excessive energy, required costly maintenance, and did not offer special effects to enhance the stadium’s entertainment experience. That’s why the Astros and the stadium owner, Harris County- Houston Sports Authority, looked to Musco for a customized solution.  
            </p>
            <p>“We are continuously looking for ways to improve the stadium experience for both our fans and our players,” said Astros President of Business Operations Reid Ryan. “The new LED lighting system will help us provide a top of the line experience while increasing our energy efficiency all year long. We look forward to seeing the field of Minute Maid Park under new lights in 2016.”
          </p>
           <p>Musco’s lighting solution will provide a variety of benefits that will help stadium officials conserve energy, save money, and improve the experience for spectators, athletes, and television broadcasts.</p>
           <ul>
                <li class="bwlistitemmargb">Cuts energy consumption by 52 percent, enough to power 380 Texas homes for each hour of use</li>
                <li class="bwlistitemmargb">Reduces glare with specially designed optics allowing players to see the complete trajectory of the ball </li>
                <li class="bwlistitemmargb">Creates a stage-like atmosphere for fans</li>
                <li class="bwlistitemmargb">Eliminates maintenance with Musco’s long-term parts and labor warranty</li>
            </ul>
            <p>“We’ve been helping customers for four decades provide energy-efficient solutions that improve the playing environment for athletes and fans,” said Jeff Rogers, Vice President, Musco Lighting. “The new system will not only save the Astros one million dollars in operating costs over the next 10 years, but will bring a new level of entertainment with special effects and our patented optics.” 
            </p>
            <p>Minute Maid Park will become the second MLB venue to install Musco’s innovative LED solution and joins an extensive list of premier facilities that feature a customized Musco LED lighting system. That list includes the Houston Texans’ NRG Stadium, the San Antonio Spurs’ AT&T Center, and Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium.</p>

                About Houston Astros / Minute Maid Park
            </p>
            <p>The Astros have been Houston’s hometown baseball team since 1962, when the Colt .45s first took the field in Colt Stadium. Three years later, the team became the Houston Astros, now in their 55th season in Major League Baseball. In 2013, the Astros moved to the American League West Division, becoming the first franchise to move from the National League to the American League. For 81 games a year, the Astros can be found on their home field at Minute Maid Park, where families and friends come together to enjoy America’s favorite pastime in one of baseball’s most comfortable and fan-friendly ballparks. In addition to striving for success on the field, the Astros take pride in their local community and are committed to making Houston a better place by honoring our nation’s military, combatting homelessness, aiding in the fight against cancer and supporting youth baseball and softball through the Astros Foundation’s cornerstone programs.
