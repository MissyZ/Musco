      MUSCO ENGINEERS SOLUTION TO SOLVE GLARE ISSUES AT UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, COLORADO SPRINGS</div>
                COLORADO SPRINGS, CO--Musco’s innovative LED lighting system has helped the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (UCCS) solve a major issue with the surrounding community.

            <p>When  lights were installed in 2014 at the University&rsquo;s Alpine Field outdoor sports  facility, residents who lived in the surrounding area immediately notified UCCS.  Even though the original design met  horizontal spill requirements, light from the luminaire was creating glare viewed  from their homes. After the original lighting supplier was unable to find a  solution, UCCS contacted Musco&rsquo;s Colorado sales representative to meet on site  to see what could be done to remedy the issue.</p>
<p>Within  days, Musco technicians and engineers were on site examining the situation. The  original lights were installed on four 90-foot poles at each corner of the  85,000-square-foot field, which is used for recreation flag football, rugby,  soccer, and lacrosse. The challenge was to find a solution that would still use  the existing poles, but would significantly reduce the amount of glare and  spill light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  were very pleased with Musco&rsquo;s response,&rdquo; said Gary Reynolds, Assistant Vice  Chancellor for Administration at UCCS. &ldquo;Their representative was down here  within several days, we explained the problem, and they engineered a solution  using Musco&rsquo;s LED technology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  solution was Musco&rsquo;s SportsCluster Green™ LED system, which directs light with  pinpoint precision and enhances the light on the playing field, while  dramatically reducing spill and glare.</p>
<p>The new system delivers to Alpine Field a  cleaner, brighter, more uniformly distributed light. It has also reduced energy  consumption at the facility. In fact, the new system cut energy consumption at  Alpine Field by 53 percent.</p>
           
          <p>&ldquo;The  system that we have designed around the LED light source has allowed us to  install lighting on fields in the heart of communities without negatively impacting  area residents,&rdquo; said Jeff Rogers, Vice President, Musco Lighting. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re proud  to have worked with the university to find a solution to its problem that  benefits athletes, the university, and community members.&rdquo;</p>
